**Description**
[leetcode 654](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-tree/description/)
Given an integer array with no duplicates. A maximum tree building on this array is defined as follow:

The root is the maximum number in the array.
The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided by the maximum number.
The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray divided by the maximum number.
Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this tree.

Example 1:
```java
Input: [3,2,1,6,0,5]
```
Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:
```java
      6
    /   \
   3     5
    \    / 
     2  0   
       \
        1
```
Note:
The size of the given array will be in the range [1,1000].

## Java recursive O(nlogn) solution
Devide and Conquer is usually the common approach to solve this kind of problems.
The only thing bear noticing is the time complexity -- average O(nlogn), worst case O(n^2), the logn is the number of levels the list got divided.
Like the quick sort, a randomizing may be needed to avoid the O(n^2) worst case senario. But it does not apply to this problem since we want to preserve the
original order of the input list.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode constructMaximumBinaryTree(int[] nums) {
        return divideAndReturnRoot(nums, 0, nums.length-1);
    }
    
    private TreeNode divideAndReturnRoot(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        /**
        * @analysis: O(nlogn) time complexity, O(1) space complexity.
        */
        if (i > j)  return null;
        int rootPos = findLargestNumIndex(nums, i, j);
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(nums[rootPos]); //tocheck index error
        root.left = divideAndReturnRoot(nums, i, rootPos-1);
        root.right = divideAndReturnRoot(nums, rootPos+1, j);
        return root;
    }
    
    private int findLargestNumIndex(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int ret = 0, temp = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int k=i; k<=j; k++) {
            if (nums[k] >= temp){
                ret = k;
                temp = nums[k];
            }
        }
        return ret;
        
    }
}
```
