**Description**,
Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

Example:
```python
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[2,3]
```

[The leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/#/description)

### Using array index to store the "extra piece of information".
When a **number** i, flip the **position** i-1 in the array to negative.
When the duplicated **number** i is encountered, you will see the number stored at **position** i-1 is a negative one.
Then you found one.

repeat this to the end of the array.


Time complexity: O(n)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums:   List[int]
        :rtype:       List[int]
        :runtime:     632ms
        :faster than: 50%
        """
        ret = []
        for num in nums:
            if nums[abs(num)-1] < 0:
                ret.append(abs(num))
            else:
                nums[abs(num)-1] *= -1
        return ret
        
```
