**Description**
[Lintcode 75](http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/find-peak-element/)
There is an integer array which has the following features:

The numbers in adjacent positions are different.
```java
A[0] < A[1] && A[A.length - 2] > A[A.length - 1].
```
We define a position P is a peek if:
```java
A[P] > A[P-1] && A[P] > A[P+1]
```
Find a peak element in this array. Return the index of the peak.

Notice

It's guaranteed the array has at least one peak.
The array may contain multiple peeks, find any of them.
The array has at least 3 numbers in it.


## Python Binary Search Solution
Since A[P] > A[P-1] && A[P] > A[P+1], we can assure that the mid + 1 will not fall out of the index bounds.
There are four possible scenarios where the mid falls, and they can be combined into just one if-else check.

See below,

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param: A: An integers array.
    @return: return any of peek positions.
    """
    def findPeak(self, A):
        # write your code here
        nums = A
        lo, hi = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        # # list all four possible scenarios
        # while lo <= hi:
        #     mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2
        #     if nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] and nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]:
        #         return mid
        #     if nums[mid] < nums[mid+1] and nums[mid] < nums[mid-1]:
        #         lo = mid + 1
        #     if nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] and nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]:
        #         lo = mid + 1
        #     if nums[mid] < nums[mid-1] and nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]:
        #         hi = mid - 1
        # return -1
        
        while lo < hi:
            mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
                hi = mid
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
        return hi

        # Total Runtime: 1006 ms
        # 100% test cases passed.
        
```
