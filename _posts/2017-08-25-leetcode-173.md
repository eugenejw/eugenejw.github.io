**Description**
[leetcode 173](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-iterator/description/)
Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.

Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.



## Python deque solution
No-brainer solution, as below,
BTW, I am not sure why this problem is labelled as "Medium", since it is easy.

```python
# Definition for a  binary tree node
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
from collections import deque

class BSTIterator(object):
    def __init__(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        """
        self.root = root
        self._stack = deque()
        self.dfs(self.root)
        
    def dfs(self, root):
        if not root:
            return
        self.dfs(root.left)
        self._stack.append(root.val)
        self.dfs(root.right)
        

    def hasNext(self):
        """
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return len(self._stack)!=0
        

    def next(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """
        return self._stack.popleft()
        

# Your BSTIterator will be called like this:
# i, v = BSTIterator(root), []
# while i.hasNext(): v.append(i.next())
```

## Java In-order solution.
After re-thinking about the problem, maybe traversing the whole tree and store all node value to a stack is not affrodable,
since it could be larger than the RAM can hold.
In this case, I thought maybe this problem is demanding its hasNext() to have O(hight) time complexity, and next() to have O(1) time-complexity.
That is the algorithm keeps track of the root only, each hasNext() call will cost O(height) time to traverse down to the smallest one.
This is reasonable, it is like the Trie Tree data structure, the hasWord() query is costing O(lenthOfTheWord) time complexity.

```java
/**
 * Definition for binary tree
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

public class BSTIterator {
    private TreeNode ret;
    private TreeNode root;
    private HashSet<TreeNode> visited;
    public BSTIterator(TreeNode root) {
        visited = new HashSet<>();
        this.root = root;
    }

    /** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
    public boolean hasNext() {
        ret = null;
        dfs(root);
        if (ret!=null) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    /** @return the next smallest number */
    public int next() {
        return ret.val;
    }
    
    private void dfs(TreeNode root) {
        if (root==null || ret!=null)   return;
        if (ret==null && !visited.contains(root)) {
            dfs(root.left);
        }
        if (ret==null && !visited.contains(root)) {
            ret = root;
            visited.add(root);
            return;
        }
        if (ret==null) dfs(root.right);
    }
}

/**
 * Your BSTIterator will be called like this:
 * BSTIterator i = new BSTIterator(root);
 * while (i.hasNext()) v[f()] = i.next();
 */
