**Description**,
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

### Loop and Mask
The solution is straight-forward. We check each of the 32 bits of the number. If the bit is 1, we add one to the number of 1-bits.

We start with a mask m=1, because the binary representation of 1 is,

```java
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001
```

Clearly, a logical AND between any number and the mask 1 gives us the least significant bit of this number. To check the next bit, we shift the mask to the left by one.

```java
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        mask = 1
        for _ in xrange(32):
            if n & mask != 0:
                count += 1
            mask <<= 1
            
        return count
        
```

### Flip and Cancel
We can make the previous algorithm simpler and a little faster. Instead of checking every bit of the number, we repeatedly flip the least-significant 1-bit of the number to 0, and add 1 to the sum. As soon as the number becomes 0 we know that it does not have any more 1-bits, and we return the sum.

The key idea here is to realize that for any number n, doing a bit-wise AND of n and n−1 flips the least-significant 1-bit in n to 0.

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        /**
        * Flip and cancel the least-significant "1"
        * @runtime:        2ms
        * @timeComplexity: O(1) -- constant time
        */
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            count++;
            n &= (n-1);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
