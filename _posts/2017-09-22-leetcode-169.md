**Description**

[169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/)

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

## Python O(n) Boyer-Moore Majority Voting algorithm

ToDo: try to achieve O(logn) by finding n/2 largest element like the pivot part of the quick sort.

```python

class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        majority = None
        count = 0
        for num in nums:
            if count==0:
                majority = num
                count += 1
            else:
                if num==majority:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count -= 1
        return majority
