**Description**
[374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/description/)
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

```java
You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```
Example:
```java
n = 10, I pick 6.

Return 6.
```

## Python Binary Search O(logn) solution

```python
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):

class Solution(object):
    def guessNumber(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        lo, hi = 1, n
        while lo <= hi:
            mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2
            res = guess(mid)
            if res == 0:
                return mid
            elif res == -1:
                hi = mid - 1
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
        return -1
```
