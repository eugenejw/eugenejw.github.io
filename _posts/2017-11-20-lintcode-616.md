**Description**
[Lintcode 616](http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/course-schedule-ii/)
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
```java
Given n = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Return [0,1]

Given n = 4, prerequisites = [1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Return [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
```

## Python BFS
BFS visits neighbor only when its in-degree is 0.

```python
from collections import (defaultdict, deque)
class Solution:
    """
    @param: numCourses: a total of n courses
    @param: prerequisites: a list of prerequisite pairs
    @return: the course order
    """
    def findOrder(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        # write your code here
        neighbors = {i: set() for i in xrange(numCourses)}
        inDegreeCount = {i: 0 for i in xrange(numCourses)}
        
        seen = set() # To filter duplicated pairs ...
        for course, prerequisite in prerequisites:
            if (course, prerequisite) not in seen:
                seen.add((course, prerequisite))
                neighbors[prerequisite].add(course)
                inDegreeCount[course] += 1
        
        queue = deque()
        for i in inDegreeCount:
            if inDegreeCount[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i) 
        
        schedule = []
        while queue:
            qSize = len(queue)
            for _ in xrange(qSize):
                curNode = queue.popleft()
                schedule.append(curNode)
                if curNode in neighbors: # has neighbor(s)
                    for neighbor in neighbors[curNode]:
                        inDegreeCount[neighbor] -= 1
                        if inDegreeCount[neighbor] == 0:
                            queue.append(neighbor)
                        
        # print  schedule       
        if len(schedule) != numCourses:
            return []
        else:
            return schedule
                    
        # Total Runtime: 3831 ms
        # 100% test cases passed.
            
```
