**Description**

[338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/description/)

Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example:
```java
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].
```

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.




## Java DP solution
The solution is based on [this post](http://weihan.online/blog/eugenejw.github.io/_site/2017/07/leetcode-191.html)


```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        int[] dp = new int[num+1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i=1; i<num+1; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i&(i-1)] + 1;
        }
        return dp;
    }
}
```
