**Description**
[96. Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/description/)
Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values **1...n**?

For example,
```java
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```


## Java Recurssive DP
This is a typical Dynamic Programming(DP) problem -- the bigger n problem can always be broken up into similar smaller problems.
DP is probably the most intresting yet challenging algorithm design problems. The solutions usually do not have a fixed pattern to follow (for example, DFS for tree problems).
In this specific case, think of it like below,
![img]({{ site.baseurl | prepend:site.url}}/images/96.jpg){: .left-image }

So for each smaller **n**, you store it in a DP array so that you only need to calculate it once.


```java
class Solution {
    
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        return dP(n, dp);
    }
    
    private int dP(int n, int[] dp) {
        if (n==0)   return 0;
        if (dp[n] != 0) return dp[n];
        
        int tempSum = 0;
        for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            tempSum += Math.max(1, (dP(i-1, dp)))  *  Math.max(1, dP(n-i, dp));
        }
        dp[n] = tempSum;
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

## Python Iterative DP
Iterative solution is focusing more on the dp array building. Personally, it is less natural, in terms of thinking, than the recurssive solution above.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numTrees(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 1
        for i in xrange(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = 0
            for j in xrange(1, i+1):
                dp[i] += dp[j-1]*dp[i-j]
        return dp[n]
            
            

```
