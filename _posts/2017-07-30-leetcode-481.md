**Description**,
A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string S itself.

The first few elements of string S is the following: S = "1221121221221121122……"

If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:

1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......

and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:

1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......

You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the S itself.

Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string S.

Note: N will not exceed 100,000.

Example 1:
```java
Input: 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.
```

## Two Pointer Solution
Algorithm:

Create an int array a and initialize the first 3 elements with 1, 2, 2.

Create two pointers head and tail. head points to the number which will be used to generate new numbers. tail points to the next empty position to put the new number. Then keep generating new numbers until tail >= n.

Need to create the array 1 element more than n to avoid overflow because the last round head might points to a number 2.

A trick to flip number back and forth between 1 and 2: num = num ^ 3 or num = num1 + num2 - num

```java
public class Solution {
    public int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        else if (n < 4) return 1;
        
        int[] magStr = new int[n+1];
        magStr[0] = 1; magStr[1] = 2; magStr[2] = 2;
        int head = 2, tail = 3, num = 1, ret = 1;
        while (tail < n) {
            for (int i=0; i<magStr[head]; i++) {
                magStr[tail] = num;
                if (num == 1 && tail<n)   ret++;
                tail++;
            }
            head++;
            num = 3 - num; // flip the num
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```
