**Description**
[254. Factor Combinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/factor-combinations/description/)
Numbers can be regarded as product of its factors. For example,
```java
8 = 2 x 2 x 2;
  = 2 x 4.
```
Write a function that takes an integer n and return all possible combinations of its factors.

Note: 
You may assume that n is always positive.
Factors should be greater than 1 and less than n.
Examples: 
```java
input: 1
output: 
[]
```
```java
input: 37
output: 
[]
```
```java
input: 12
output:
[
  [2, 6],
  [2, 2, 3],
  [3, 4]
]
```
```java
input: 32
output:
[
  [2, 16],
  [2, 2, 8],
  [2, 2, 2, 4],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
  [2, 4, 4],
  [4, 8]
]
```

## Python O(2^n) backtracking
Note that the performance ranked very low is because the test cases pool have been updated.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def getFactors(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        ret = []
        factors = [i for i in xrange(2, n) if n % i == 0]
        self.dfs(n, 2, [], ret, factors)
        return ret
    
    def dfs(self, n, factor, path, ret, factors):
        if n == 1:
            if len(path) > 0:
                ret.append(path[:])
            return
        
        for i in factors:
            if i >=factor and i <= n and n % i == 0:
                path.append(i)
                self.dfs(n/i, i, path, ret, factors)
                path.pop()            
```
