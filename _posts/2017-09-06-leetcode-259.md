**Description**
[259. 3Sum Smaller](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-smaller/description/)



Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.

For example, given nums = [-2, 0, 1, 3], and target = 2.

Return 2. Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:

[-2, 0, 1]
[-2, 0, 3]

Could you solve it in O(n2) runtime?



## Java Two Pointers solution
Let us try sorting the array first. For example, nums = [3,5,2,8,1]nums=[3,5,2,8,1] becomes [1,2,3,5,8][1,2,3,5,8].

Let us look at an example nums = [1,2,3,5,8], and target = 7
```java
[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
 ↑           ↑
left       right
```
Let us initialize two indices, leftleft and rightright pointing to the first and last element respectively.

When we look at the sum of first and last element, it is 1 + 8 = 9, which is ≥ target. That tells us no index pair will ever contain the index rightright. So the next logical step is to move the right pointer one step to its left.
```java
[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
 ↑        ↑
left    right
```
Now the pair sum is 1 + 5 = 6, which is < target. How many pairs with one of the index = left that satisfy the condition? You can tell by the difference between rightright and leftleft which is 33, namely (1,2), (1,3), and (1,5). Therefore, we move leftleft one step to its right.

```java
class Solution {
    public int threeSumSmaller(int[] nums, int target) {
        int ret = 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int i=0; i<n-2; i++) {
            int diff = target - nums[i];
            int lo=i+1, hi=n-1;
            
            while (lo<hi) {
                if (nums[lo]+nums[hi] < diff) {
                    ret += hi-lo;
                    lo++;
                } else {
                    hi--;
                }
            }
        }
        return ret;
    }
}

```
