**Description**
[leetcode 276](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-fence/description/)
There is a fence with n posts, each post can be painted with one of the k colors.

You have to paint all the posts such that no more than two adjacent fence posts have the same color.

Return the total number of ways you can paint the fence.

Note:
n and k are non-negative integers.

## Java DP solution
Induction could be visualized as picture below (n=3, k=3 example, ignore the brown numbers, they are for n=4, k=3),

We only consider the most recent two fences that got painted, to make the algorithm working, we need to classify them into two types of fences,
1. the most recent two fences are of the same colors.
2. the most recent two fences are of differebt colors.

Iterating i from 3 to n. For every i, (because we have restriction that no more than two adjacent fence are in the same color), we can see that the the the new same-color-fences combinations are always generated from previous diff-color-fences combinations.
And the new diff-color-fences can be genreated from all previous combinations.

Look at code below, and think about it.
```java
class Solution {
    public int numWays(int n, int k) {
        if (n==0 || k==0)   return 0;
        if (n==1)   return k;
        if (n==2)   return k*k;
        int sameNumSum = k, diffNumSum = k*k-k;
        for (int i=3; i<=n; i++) {
            int tempSameSum = sameNumSum;
            sameNumSum = diffNumSum;
            diffNumSum = (tempSameSum + diffNumSum) * (k-1);
        }
        
        return sameNumSum + diffNumSum;
    }
}
```
