title: Single Element in a Sorted Array (leetcode 540)
category: Coding
tags: [Algorithm, Binary Search, leetcode, Medium, Java, Python]
---

**Description**,
Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears twice except for one element which appears once. Find this single element that appears only once.

Example 1:
```python
Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```python
Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
```
Note: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

### Binary Search
O(logn), so it must be a binary search solution.
Let's think of the following case,
```java
[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10]
```
We can treat it pair-wise, like below,
```java
[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10]
--0--  --1-  --2-  --3-  --4-  --5--  -6-
```
Then apply binary search on these pairs.
For example, if the mid index is a pair formed by the same number, like [3, 3], we move lo to mid+1.
If the mid index is a pair formed by different number, we move hi to mid. (not mid-1).

Time complexity: O(logn)

```java
public class Solution {
    /**
    * @timeComplexity: O(logn)
    * @solution:       Binary Search
    * @runtime:        1ms 
    */
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = nums.length/2;
        int mid = 0;
        while (lo < hi) {
            mid = (hi+lo)/2; // to avoid overflow
            if (nums[2*mid] == nums[2*mid+1]) { // means the "not same pairs" are to its right
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[2*lo];
        
    }
}
```
