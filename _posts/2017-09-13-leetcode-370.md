**Description**

[370. Range Addition](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition/description/)
Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.

Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.

Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.

Example:
```java
Given:

    length = 5,
    updates = [
        [1,  3,  2],
        [2,  4,  3],
        [0,  2, -2]
    ]

Output:

    [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]
```
Explanation:
```java
Initial state:
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

After applying operation [1, 3, 2]:
[ 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 ]

After applying operation [2, 4, 3]:
[ 0, 2, 5, 5, 3 ]

After applying operation [0, 2, -2]:
[-2, 0, 3, 5, 3 ]
```

## Java Brute-force solution
Brute-force solution, which is a O(nk) algorithm. However accepted by virtue of choosing a fast language like Java.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] getModifiedArray(int length, int[][] updates) {
        /**
        * @timeComp:    O(nk), where n is length, k is num of updates (worst case scenario that each update is of length n)
        * @tuntime:     457ms
        *
        */
        int[] ret = new int[length];
        for (int[] update : updates) {
            int start = update[0], end = update[1];
            if (start>=0 && start<length && end>=0 && end<length) {
                for (int i=start; i<=end; i++) {
                    ret[i] += update[2];
                }
            }
            
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```

## Python Carry solution
For each update, we only mark the start position and the end+1 position.

Put inc at startIndex allows the inc to be carried to the next index starting from startIndex when we do the sum accumulation.
Put -inc at endIndex + 1 simply means cancel out the previous carry from the next index of the endIndex, because the previous carry should not be counted beyond endIndex.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def getModifiedArray(self, length, updates):
        """
        :type length:   int
        :type updates:  List[List[int]]
        :rtype:         List[int]
        :runtime:       225ms
        :timeComp:      O(n+k), where n is length, k is len(updates)
        """
        ret = [0] * length
        for update in updates:
            start = update[0]
            end = update[1]
            inc = update[2]
            ret[start] += inc
            
            if end < length-1:
                ret[end+1] -= inc

        carry = 0
        for i in xrange(length):
            carry += ret[i]
            ret[i] = carry
            
        return ret
            
        
```
