**Description**
[503. Next Greater Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/description/)
Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
```java
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
```
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
Note: The length of given array won't exceed 10000.


## Java Stack solution
The solution is illustrated as picture below,
![img]({{ site.baseurl | prepend:site.url}}/images/503.jpg){: .left-image }

Basically, the idea is that we only look at the points where nums[i]>nums[i-1]. And we should iterate backwards.


```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] ret = new int[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i=2*n-1; i>=0; i--) {
            while (!stack.empty() && stack.peek()<=nums[i%n]) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            ret[i%n] = stack.empty() ? -1 : stack.peek();
            stack.push(nums[i%n]);
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```

![img]({{ site.baseurl | prepend:site.url}}/images/503_java.jpg){: .center-image }*Runtime: around 65ms*
