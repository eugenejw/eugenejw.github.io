**Description**
[496. Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/description/)
You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
```java
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
```
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
Example 2:
```java
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
```
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
Note:
All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.

## Java Stack solution
Basically, the idea is that we only look at the points where nums[i]>nums[i-1]. And we should iterate backwards.


```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElement(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        int n = nums2.length;
        int[] tempList = new int[n];
        int[] ret = new int[nums1.length];
        
        for (int i=n-1; i>=0; i--) {
            while (!stack.empty() && stack.peek()<=nums2[i]) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            tempList[i] = stack.empty() ? -1 : stack.peek();
            hm.put(nums2[i], tempList[i]);
            stack.push(nums2[i]);
        }
        
        for (int i=0; i<nums1.length; i++) {
            ret[i] = hm.get(nums1[i]);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
