**Description**

[491. Increasing Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-subsequences/description/)

Given an integer array, your task is to find all the different possible increasing subsequences of the given array, and the length of an increasing subsequence should be at least 2 .
```java
Example:
Input: [4, 6, 7, 7]
Output: [[4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 6, 7], [4, 6, 7, 7], [6, 7], [6, 7, 7], [7,7], [4,7,7]]
```
Note:
The length of the given array will not exceed 15.
The range of integer in the given array is [-100,100].
The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be considered as a special case of increasing sequence.

## Backtracking with DFS O(2^n) solution
This is a classic getting combination via backtracking problem.
The tricky part is to avoid duplicated elements in the result list.


```python
class Solution(object):
    def findSubsequences(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        ret = []
        self.dfs(nums, len(nums), 0, [], ret)
        return ret
        
    def dfs(self, nums, n, start, path, ret):
        if len(path) > 1:
            ret.append(path[:])
        used = set() # avoid duplicated results
        for i in xrange(start, n):
            if nums[i] not in used and ((len(path)==0) or nums[i] >= path[-1]):
                used.add(nums[i])
                path.append(nums[i])
                self.dfs(nums, n, i+1, path, ret)
                path.pop()
                                            
```
